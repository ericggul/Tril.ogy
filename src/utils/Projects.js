    introduction: `A Geometrical Axiom, such as "Orthocenter, Circumcenter, Gravity Points share collinearity.", are derived from our Accumulated Abstract Knowledge.
    However, in order for us to understand the geometrical axiom, we should always interpret the abstract knowledge into the descriptive geometrical shapes.
    The Euclidean lines and circles above offers us a bridge that links to the abstract world, but still it takes part within the descriptive images.
    My purpose of this project was to create the new usage of these Euclidean images, by highlighting its descriptiveness rather than its abstractness.
    Can Euclidean lines and circles themselves create an aesthetic impression?`,

    New Towns are like 'Liberty Street and Ford Avenue': A random street and random avenue, filled with identical apartments, which can be find anywhere but cannot be distinguished.
    However, their real situation are positioning the opposite direction, which can be summarized as 'Anti Liberty and Distorted Fordism': Anti-Liberty in terms of its lifestyle, and Distorted Fordism in terms of its failure of delivering cheap mass-produced residential flats.
    This infographics highlights this paradox in six dimensions, questioning and criticizing the lifestyle of many Koreans.`,
